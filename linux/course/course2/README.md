## A Beginner's Guide to Linux Kernel Development (LFD103)

## Training/Certification Firewall
The Linux Foundation has two separate training divisions: Course Delivery and Certification. These two divisions are separated by a firewall.

The curriculum development and maintenance division of the Linux Foundation Training department has no direct role in developing, administering, or grading certification exams.

Enforcing this self-imposed firewall ensures that independent organizations and companies can develop third party training material, geared towards helping test takers pass their certification exams.

Furthermore, it ensures that there are no secret "tips" (or secrets in general) that one needs to be familiar with in order to succeed.

It also permits the Linux Foundation to develop a very robust set of courses that do far more than teach the test, but rather equip attendees with a broad knowledge of the many areas they may be required to master to have a successful career in open source system administration.
