## Chapter 5. Processes and System Monitoring

Monitoring your system is important to make sure it is operating at peak performance, that applications are behaving properly, and that you are not being attacked by some hostile actor that is corrupting the system.

There are many different command line tools which are used for monitoring, and we will tend to use them in this course, though there are graphical tools available. The graphical tools vary quite a bit from Linux distribution to Linux distribution. So, most Linux system administrators concentrate on the command line tools.

- We will look at process monitoring and the two main tools used every day are ‘top’ and ‘ps’.
- We will examine memory usage using programs like ‘free’ and ‘vmstat’.
- Understand the concept of inventory and gain familiarity with available system monitoring tools.
- Understand where the system stores log files and examine the most important ones.
- Use the /proc and /sys pseudo-filesystems.
- Use sar to gather system activity and performance data and create reports that are readable by humans.
